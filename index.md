## Fungicides: Pollinator health (see also Pollinators and neonics)

May 2019, Quarterly

- That we work collaboratively with bee keepers in British Columbia to better understand the causes of poor colony health after pollination of blueberry crops.
- That bee health is a complex issue impacted by a number of factors and the plant science industry is committed to doing its part to protect pollinators.
- That the plant science industry supports sound, science-based decision making around the use of pesticides as this relates to pollinator health.


## Fungicides: Value of co-formulated products

May 2019     Quarterly

- That co-formulated fungicides effectively and efficiently deliver broader spectrum pest control and help ensure that pests that may be resistant to a mode of action are effectively controlled.
- That co-formulated fungicides make it easier for growers to mix and ensure proper rates by providing uniform, stable products in a single container.

## Maximum residue limits (MRLs) and trade

May 2019      Annual

- That we engage with governments and partners to create conditions that allow China to promulgate transparent, predictable, risk-based import tolerance regulations based on international standards and guidelines, recognizing that MRLs facilitate trade by verifying that pesticides have been applied according to registered label specifications and that they are not food safety standards.
- That we engage with governments and our partners to contain Europe's hazard-based approaches and defend risk-based decisions that allow farmers to continue to access modern tools and technologies that keep them competitive domestically and globally.

[September 12, 2018 ](https://members.croplife.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Draft-Minutes-September-12-2018-Chemistry-Committee-Meeting-Toronto-V3.pdf) Staff Directive

China Strategy

- If China's import tolerance policy towards Canada were to be predictable, this market would be a lower tier work priority.

European Union
- The current level of effort is appropriate with participation in the CLI MRL &amp; Trade Task Force and the CLA Trade Team.
- Consideration should be given to developing an industry strategy to deal with loss of AIs from EU market.

## National surface water monitoring for pesticides

May 2019     Semi-annual

_In response to the absence of a coherent, Canada-wide network of pesticide water monitoring studies, PMRA has taken overly conservative approaches in their risk assessments for post-market re-evaluations, resulting in cancelation of uses that would otherwise represent acceptable risks._

- That robust, clear and transparent national protocols be explored as a means to provide PMRA with the ability to confidently refine post-market risk assessments when needed and to document the effectiveness of industry and grower-led risk mitigation initiatives.

[January 22, 2019 ](https://members.croplife.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Draft-Minutes-January-22-2019-Chemistry-Committee-Meeting-Calgary-V2.pdf) Staff Directive

Gather more information about water monitoring in Canada, in other jurisdictions and from other actors active in this subject area, including academics and the pharmaceutical industry to inform further development of CLC's policy positions.

[November 29, 2018    ](https://members.croplife.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Draft-Minutes-November-29-2018-Chemistry-Committee-Meeting-Ottawa-002.pdf) Staff Directive

Take a leadership role in recommending a national water monitoring program (including vision, objectives, responsible government department, funding models, etc.).

[September 12, 2018](https://members.croplife.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Draft-Minutes-September-12-2018-Chemistry-Committee-Meeting-Toronto-V3.pdf) Staff Directive

Actively participate in development with a view to ensuring having a say. While CLC members may consider contributing financially to ensure we can credibly continue to direct its activities, CLC members should not be the principle funders of such an initiative.

## Ontario pesticide reform – neonicotinoids and agriculture

May 2019     Quarterly

- That the Government of Ontario immediately remove the regulation that restrict the use of neonicotinoid seed under the _Ontario Pesticides Act_ in order to allow Ontario farmers to have the same access to these safe crop protection innovations as farmers in other jurisdictions.
- That the current duplicative provincial pesticide classification system be replaced with one that recognizes and makes use of the work already being done federally in this regard by the PMRA.


## Ontario pesticide reform – Ontario Pesticide Advisory Committee (OPAC)

May 2019     Quarterly

- That OPAC should be wound up and disbanded as it is the only provincial regulatory body of its kind in Canada and clearly duplicates work already being performed by PMRA.

## Ontario pesticide reform - urban

May 2019     Quarterly

- That the Government of Ontario lift the so-called &quot;cosmetic&quot; pesticide ban to instead return to a level playing field for Ontario homeowners and small business people.
- That we do not support the creation of a new class of pesticides granting an application monopoly to licensed applicators to the detriment of homeowners.

## PCPA legislative review 2020

May 2019     Quarterly

- That pre- and post-market reviews include stronger consideration of social and economic value.
- That guidance be provided to clarify acceptable risk and unacceptable risk to assure transparency.
- That Europe's interpretation of the precautionary principle continues to be rejected and has no place in the Act – Canada's risk-based approach is appropriate and already consistent with regulators' &quot;duty to prevent harm&quot;;
- That evaluations be completed in a timely fashion but that legislated timeframes are not appropriate; and
- That the Act's provisions for greater transparency and openness continue to be appropriately balanced with the protection of confidential business information in order to drive continued innovation.


## PMRA re-evaluation – cost recovery
[September 12, 2018    ](https://members.croplife.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Draft-Minutes-September-12-2018-Chemistry-Committee-Meeting-Toronto-V3.pdf) Staff Directive

- The following conditions need to be met before a conversation about cost re-recovery would be appropriate:
  - Data protection issues (PPIP) resolved to industry satisfaction;
  - Effective process improvements; and
  - PMRA being sufficiently resourced to assure the workload can be completed within a reasonable period of time.

- Conditions for cost-recovery to be considered include:
  - Clear data requirements;
  - Clear transparent processes; and
  - Strict adherence to time lines with meaningful recourse for missing them.

## PMRA re-evaluation process improvement
May 2019     Annual

_The changes PMRA made to its re-evaluation process in 2016 have resulted in incomplete risk assessments and overly conservative decisions that unnecessarily restrict uses of high economic value._

- That PMRA allow meaningful two-way technical dialogue with stakeholders prior to initiation and throughout the re-evaluation process.
- That public consultations be sought on the draft risk assessment separately from the proposed decision that includes proposed risk mitigation measures.
- That the Government of Canada formally acknowledge the economic role PMRA plays in facilitating or inhibiting grower access to innovative technologies by including this in its mandate and by allocating the appropriate resources for this work.

[September 12, 2018    ](https://members.croplife.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Draft-Minutes-September-12-2018-Chemistry-Committee-Meeting-Toronto-V3.pdf) Staff Directive
- The Committee directed staff to advocate for an economic/growth mandate for PMRA.


## Protected agriculture stewardship

_Growers need access to the full suite of registered minor uses of pesticides to remain competitive both domestically and internationally. To assure this, potential pathways to the environment and the risks posed need to be proactively addressed in ways acceptable to PMRA. Protected agriculture systems consist of greenhouses, shade houses, nurseries and high tunnels._

May 2018     Semiannual

- That a credible industry-led pesticide lifecycle stewardship approach be collaboratively constructed and implemented that includes adherence to national standards that are within industry control to support compliance with registered pesticide label directions and ensure the health and safety of people and the environment.

[September 12, 2018](https://members.croplife.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Draft-Minutes-September-12-2018-Chemistry-Committee-Meeting-Toronto-V3.pdf) Staff Directive

- Proactively proceed with this initiative even if PMRA does not see this subsector as a major concern as it addresses the risk of additional problems being identified through national water monitoring in the future.
- It is understood that an industry-wide no-ship policy would be how compliance would be assured.
- While CLC is helping to set up the program, delivery should be paid for by the grower groups.

## BIT disruption

_Changes to registered chemistry formulations are required to address a critical global supply interruption of BIT, a widely used micro-biocide preservative. The PMRA addressed a shorter-term BIT shortage in late 2018 by allowing a limited number of different BIT- and non-BIT-containing preservatives to be added to formulations. However, this approach will not address the severe supply disruption now being faced. If not resolved, the availability of pest control products for the 2020 Canadian growing season may be jeopardized._

May 2019     Quarterly

- That as an interim measure to address the BIT shortage, PMRA provide a pre-approved list of non-bit alternatives that may be added to formulations.
- That self-certification and batched notification of non-bit alternatives be accepted to address the BIT shortage.
- That PMRA expedite approval of Category C submissions for formulation changes to include non-bit alternatives.

## CGC Market Acceptance Policy

_This industry-led policy strives to provide an appropriate balance between enabling the commercialization of innovative and new chemistry/crop use products, while assuring shippers and growers that Canadian exports are not exposed to unacceptable trade risks of shipments being rejected at port._

May 2019    Quarterly
- That the policy is a work in progress in which CropLife Canada and its members are actively participating in with a view to continuous improvement.

## CropLife Canada support of CAAR

[September 12, 2018    Motion](https://members.croplife.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Draft-Minutes-September-12-2018-Chemistry-Committee-Meeting-Toronto-V3.pdf)

- Motion: That support for CAAR be left as a company-specific decision, that CropLife Canada representation on the CAAR Board is not merited at this time and that CropLife Canada instead support the CAAR Board when aligned with CropLife Canada priorities.

## Defending modern agriculture innovations

May 2019    Quarterly

_As seen with glyphosate in the United States and other jurisdictions, if left unchallenged, public opinion may trump future risk-based regulatory decisions and could conceivably curtail any further pubic Government of Canada defense of the pesticide regulatory system and specific chemistries._

- That CropLife Canada work to increase decision makers' understanding and appreciation of the complexity of the systems used to produce the food we eat, its quality, affordability and other benefits including:
  - Plant science innovations are designed to produce more food;
  - Pesticides are designed to kill pests that threaten production; and
  - Both are carefully regulated to assure their safety to people, animals and the environment.
- That CropLife Canada continue to advocate the proven benefits of modern agriculture and that the potential risks are identified, thoroughly studied and proactively mitigated by Health Canada and the PMRA.  Benefits include:
  - An affordable, high-quality varied diet of fruit, vegetables and grain;
  - A smaller agricultural carbon foot print (less fossil fuel use, carbon sequestration); and
  - Restoration and preservation of wildlife habitat.
- That government decision makers acknowledge that the success of chemistry solutions is a prime target for funding by both the genuinely curious researchers and those opposed to modern agriculture alike.
  - The more studies there are, the more outlier results there also are which can be selectively used to prove a point, whether positive or negative.


## Drones: Label expansion
[September 12, 2018  ](https://members.croplife.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Draft-Minutes-September-12-2018-Chemistry-Committee-Meeting-Toronto-V3.pdf) Staff Directive

- The decision to proceed with a label expansion to include drone application resides with individual companies.

## Manage Resistance Now

May 2019     Annual

- That resistance to plant science technologies is a serious issue for both the crop protection industry and the broader agricultural community and that CropLife Canada staff be committed to make resistance management a high priority in the organization.

## Plant Science Technologies: Helping Canada Grow

May 2019     Annual

- That plant science technologies are helping grow the economy, protect the environment and build stronger communities across Canada.
- That pesticides and plant biotechnology help save more than 35 million acres of natural land and protect Canada's biodiversity.
- $8.3 billion, or 71% of Canada's trade balance in crops, is directly attributable to innovations in crop protection products and plant biotechnology.
- Canadian families save an average of $4,400 a year on food costs thanks to efficient, high-yield farming practices.

## Pollinators and neonics – Ontario and Quebec

May 2019     Biannually

- That:
  - The largest volume of neonic use is in western Canada as seed treatments and bee keepers there are not concerned by neonic use - the number of bee colonies in western Canada is about five times greater than in Quebec and Ontario combined.
  - PMRA's April 2019 final special review decisions on pollinators concluded that neonic seed treatments and use on greenhouse vegetables do not pose unacceptable risks to bees or other pollinators.
  - According to 2018 Statistics Canada data, the number of colonies nationally has been steadily increasing for many years, despite extensive use of neonic pesticides.
    - There were 5% less bee colonies in Ontario but honey production was up by about 35%.
    - The number of bee colonies in Quebec was up by 6.5% with a corresponding increase in honey production.


## Regulatory efficiency

May 2019     Quarterly

- That regulatory reform is critical for agriculture to be a key player in the success of Canada's economy as outlined in the Economic Strategy Table reports.
- That the promise to improve the sector's regulatory environment is a welcome development for Canadian agri-food firms, however, the government needs to implement direct action to showcase our safe, high-quality agri-food products to the world.
- That all departments, specifically Health Canada, PMRA and CFIA, must move forward with measures that, while ensuring health and safety, support industry and its ability to grow, innovate and produce food for domestic consumption and export.
- That we call for accountability, and action, to ensure the sector receives the support it needs to improve competitiveness.

## Urban pesticides

May 2019     Annual

- That urban pesticides protect public and private green spaces from insects, weeds and diseases.
- That homeowners benefit from the control a wide range of pests, including: cockroaches, ants, spiders, silverfish, flies, mosquitoes, fleas, ticks and bed bugs, rats and mice.
- That pest control products are also used in plastics, paints, and caulking to prevent mold, and in toilet bowl cleaners and disinfectants to protect health.
